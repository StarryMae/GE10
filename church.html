      <h2>Our Mother of Perpetual Help Redemptorist Church: Sunday Mass</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, September 9, 2025, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, I attended the Sunday Mass at Our Mother of Perpetual Help Redemptorist Church as an attendee. This church is my go-to place for worship every Sunday, so it already feels like a second home to me. The priests homily that day focused on the wrongdoing of politicians who committed ghost projects for flood money worth millions. He emphasizes the importance of honesty and integrity, especially for those in positions of power. Despite the power outage that occurred during the Mass, everyone stayed calm and continued to listen attentively, which made the message even more powerful.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests words opened my eyes to how corruption and greed can deeply affect the live of ordinary people. I didnt expect such a direct and fearless message, but it reminded me that the Church can also be a voice for truth and justice. The power outage could have made the atmosphere more solemn and reflective. I admire how the priest spoke with courage, addressing a serious issue that may tend to ignore. The most satisfying part of the experience was feeling inspired to live with integrity and stand up for what is right, even when it is difficult. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  Mass strengthened my belief that faith and social responsibility go hand in hand. I learned that being a good Catholic also means being aware of the injustices happening around us. I can apply this learning by being more discerning, honest, and vocal about what is right in my own community. I plan to continue supporting my church not just spiritually but also through active participation in activities that promote fairness and compassion. If I could experience that Mass again, I would take a moment to thank the priest for bravely speaking about the truth despite the circumstances.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more aware of the need to uphold truth and justice in all aspects of life. I am encouraged to live with integrity and to speak up when I see wrongdoing. Most of all, I am thankful for the reminder that faith should move us not just to pray, but also to act with courage and compassion for others.

      <h2>Our Lady of Fatima Chapel: Sunday Mass</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, September 28, 2025, from 7:00 Am to 8:00 AM, I attended a Sunday Mass at Our Lady of Fatima Chapel in Fatima Village as an attendee. It was my first time going to this church, and I was both excited and curious to experience a new environment of worship. The chapel had a calm atmosphere that immediately put me at ease. The homily focused on the story of the rich man and Lazarus, which reminded us to live with compassion and not ignore those in need. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminded me that faith is more than a prayer. It is about how we treat others in our everyday lives. I was touched by how the priest spoke with sincerity. The most satisfying part of the experience was feeling spiritually inspired to be more generous and understanding. My values of empathy and kindness were reflected through my participation and attentiveness during the Mass. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attending this Mass was very new to me as I always stay in one church to serve. I realized that spiritual growth often happens when we step out of our comfort zones. The warmth of the parish community encouraged me to keep attending and perhaps join more church activities in the future which I did. If I could do this again, I would need to know where I am going next time. It took a lot of navigation to go to one place. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more open to exploring my faith in different places. I am reminded that Gods message of compassion is present wherever we go. I am also thankful for the chance to reconnect with my spiritual values in a different setting.

      <h2>Carmelite Sisters: Maxino Beach Event</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, September 28, 2025, from 10:30 AM to 3:00 PM, me and my friend Angellina Kelley visited Maxinoâ€™s Beach House in Sibulan to host a church event for the children of the Carmelite Sisters of Our Lady. Me and Angelina took on the role of host, guiding the flow of activities and making sure the children were entertained throughout the program. The goal of this event was to share happiness, faith, and togetherness with the children through games and meaningful interaction. It was a joyful and heart warming experience that allowed us to connect with them in a fun and meaningful way.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this activity, I gained new skills in public speaking and program management. At first, we thought that hosting would be simple, but we soon realized it required a lot of energy and focus from everyone engaged throughout the day. What surprised me most was how enthusiastic and appreciative the children were, even with the smallest activities we prepared. One of the sisters left a lasting impression on us because of her consideration and genuine gratitude towards us. The most challenging part was keeping the even on schedule, but seeing the children get entertained and seeing their smiles made all the effort worth it. This experience reflected my values of service and faith, reminding me that sharing time and love with others is one of the most meaningful ways to serve God. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience deepened my understanding of what it means to serve in the church. I realized that every act of service, no matter how small, can bring others closer to GOd and strengthen our faith. I learned the importance of humility, joy, and teamwork when serving others. It is meaningful because they nurture both spiritual growth and fellowship. The things I would change if I were given the chance would be preparing for more faith-based games to make the program even more engaging.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more faithful and compassionate. I have learned to value service as a way to share Gods love with others. Most importantly, I am inspired to continue serving in the church.

      <h2>Silliman University Church: God Cares</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, October 1, 2025, from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, I attended a Wednesday Mass at Silliman University Church as an attendee. It was my first time joining a Christian Mass, as I am a Roman Catholic and usually attend services that follow a different flow and structure. The topic of the service was about how God cares, and it centered on the idea that no matter what struggles we face, Gods love and guidance remain constant. I was curious and open-minded throughout the experience, wanting to understand how other Christian communities express their faith. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, I felt slightly unfamiliar with the order of the service since it was different from what I was used to in Catholic Masses. However, as the worship continued, I began to appreciate its simplicity and sincerity. The pastor spoke with warmth and emphasized that Gods care is shown not just in miracles but also in everyday moments. The satisfying part of the experience was feeling connected to others despite our differences in tradition. Our shared faith in Gods love united us. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience gave me a broader perspective on faith and unity among Christians. It helped me realize that even though our ways of worship differ, we all seek the same comfort, hope, and guidance from God. I learned that understanding and respect are important in building harmony among different religious practices. Moving forward, I would like to attend more appreciation of diverse beliefs. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more open minded and respectful toward different Christian traditions. I am reminded that Gods love reaches beyond religion and rituals. It is felt through faith and compassion.

      <h2>University Christian Life Emphasis Month: God Cares</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, October 9, 2025, from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, I attended an activity at Silliman University as an attendee. The objective of the session was to send a message that God cares, and it was a part of an activity for all first-year students. The event started at the Amphitheater, where we had an introduction and warm-up activity that brought everyones energy together. However, when the rain started to pour, we moved into the classrooms to continue the event. There, we began the yarn string activity, passing a string to people we wanted to know better, symbolizing a connection.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought the activity would be more formal or serious, but it turned out to be meaningful and interactive. The yarn activity helped everyone relax and build friendships. We also reflected on 1 Kings 19:1-18, which taught us that Gods presence is often found in gentle and quiet moments rather than in loud or powerful ones. The rain unexpectedly added to the atmosphere, making the discussion feel calm and personal. What I enjoyed most was seeing how a simple activity could bring people closer and remind us of Gods presence in our interactions. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience made me realize that Gods care shows up not only in perfect moments but also in times of change and uncertainty. I learned how important it is to stay open and positive when plans dont go as expected. The activity helped me see the beauty of fellowship and how sharing faith with others can strengthen our own. If I could do it again, I would make an effort to talk to more people and listen to their insights, since everyones experience offers something valuable.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more aware of how God works in both simple and unexpected ways. I am more open to forming meaningful relationships and seeing Gods love through others. Most importantly, I am reminded that even when things dont go as planned, Gods care remains constant and unchanging.
