      <h2>Guidance Office: Time Management</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, July 23, 2025, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, I attended the Mastering Self-Discipline and Time Management for College Success held at the 3rd Floor of the USC Building. It was an event organized by the Guidance Office, and only a selected few students were invited to participate. I was an attendee, my goal was to learn how to manage my time better since I tend to procrastinate a lot.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned a lot about how small habits can affect productivity. We discussed common struggles like procrastination and distractions, and how they can be overcome through discipline and proper planning.We got to share our personal experiences about bad habits and time-wasting routines, which made me realize that I was not alone in struggling with these things. I also met new people from my department, and it was nice to connect with them on a more personal level.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience made me more aware of how I use my time and how easily it can slip away when I am not focused. I plan to apply the techniques I learned, such as prioritizing my tasks and setting daily goals. I will try my best to improve my study habits and manage my time wisely to become a more disciplined and productive student.

      <h2>Silliman University: All-University Convocation</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, July 30, 2025, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, I attended the All-University Student Convocation held at the Luce Auditorium in Silliman University. t was actually a requirement for all students to go, but I was still excited since it was my first time experiencing something like it. What made it even more memorable was that it was also my first time seeing the president of Silliman University in person. The main objective of the session was to welcome students to a new academic year and remind us of what it means to be part of the Silliman community.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought the convocation would just be a long, formal event where we had to sit and listen, but it turned out to be more meaningful than I expected. Listening to the speeches gave me a better understanding of what it truly means to be a Sillimanian. I realized that the university values not only academic excellence but also service, faith, and character.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience gave me a sense of belonging and motivation to do well, not just for myself but as a representative of my college and the whole university. It reminded me that every student plays a role in continuing Sillimanâ€™s legacy of excellence and service. I want to live up to those values one way or another.

      <h2>Batch 2005 Balik Talent Lectures: Paths Beyond the Code</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday August 28, 2025, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, I attended an event at the 3rd Floor of the UCS Building where alumni from the College of Computer Studies shared their experiences and journeys after college. I was actually sick that day and was also helping out at a booth, but I still made the effort to attend because I did not want to miss the chance to hear from those who once stood where we are now. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sessions goal was to let us, the younger batches, learn from the stories and advice of the older students who have already faced the real-world challenges of working in the tech field. Even though I was not feeling my best, listening to the alumni talk about their struggles and achievements really made an impact on me. They spoke about late nights, difficult projects, and how they balanced academics with personal life.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realized how important it is to stay motivated and connected with others in the same field, as shared experiences can be sources of strength. If I was not sick, I would ask more questions and engage more with the speakers to get their insights. I was a great experience overall.

      <h2>American Corner: Corner Talks</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday, September 16, 2025, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, I attended a session at the American Corner, located on the 1st floor of the Robert B. & Metta J. Silliman University Library. The goal of the event was to learn more about what the American Corner Dumaguete offers, especially for students who are interested in studying abroad or learning more about American culture, education, and opportunities.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker shared details about scholarships, student exchange programs, and resources available at the American Corner that can help students prepare for international studies. I also learned about how they support activities that promote global understanding and cultural exchange. They encouraged us to explore and ask questions about how we could make use of the materials and services there. It was eye-opening to realize that such opportunities are within reach for students like me.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realized that studying abroad is not just about going to another country that it is also about expanding your understanding of different cultures and how education systems around the world work. It inspired me to start thinking about the possibility of applying for international programs in the future and to be more proactive in seeking opportunities for growth beyond my comfort zone.

      <h2>Silliman University: City-Wide College Fair</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, October 8, 2025, from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM, I was part of the working committe for the College of Computer Studies Booth in the City-Wide College Fair at the Silliman University Gymnasium. As the CS representative, my role was to help create pamphlets and stickers for our mini game and assist in organizing our booth. It was exciting to contribute to an event that showcased our department and gave prospective students a glimpse of what we offer.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was tasked to make a pamphlet for the whole Computer Science Department. Due to busy schedule, it was very hard to manage my time figuring out where I could print good quality sticker for the booth also. Everything paid off to see visitors interacting with our booth and enjoying the mini game we prepared. Collaborating with my classmates and the student governor made the experience more meaningful and fun.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing our booth succeed made me proud of what we accomplished together. It was fun trying to help out with others and make things work out even from the limit amount of funds we have. But next time, I will try my best to manage my time better.

      <h2>Silliman University: Mental Health Caravan</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, October 8, 2025, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, I attended a Mental Health Caravan at Silliman University, Luce Auditorium. The session focused on mental health and how it can affect a persons life. I was not sure what to expect, but I wanted to learn more because mental health is something that is often overlooked, especially among students like me.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was surprising to learn how common mental health struggles are and how important it is to reach out for support. I appreciated hearing real-life experiences and tips from the speakers, which made the session feel personal and relatable. It also reminded me to be more mindful of my own mental well-being and to check in with friends who might be struggling.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned that simple actions, like listening or offering help, can make a big difference. I plan to apply this by being more aware of my own habits and encouraging open conversations about mental health with friends. This session also motivated me to participate imore in the futurel. I have come to be more aware of my own surroundings.

      <h2>Classroom Activity: Sto. NiÃ±o Orphanage White Gift</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, October 22, 2025, from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM, I participated in our last GE10 class activity at the 3rd Floor UCS Building. Our group prepared a donation box for the Sto. NiÃ±o Orphanage filled with essential items, and we even included a little message for the children. For fun, I also made two origami fishes to add a personal touch. It was a simple activity, but it felt meaningful knowing that our small contributions could make a difference in someone elses life.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really fulfilling it is to give, even in small ways. I was crafting little things like the origami fishes and it made me feel connected to the gift we were preparing. What surprised me the most was seeing how everyone in our group put effort into making the donation special. Thoughtfulness can turn something ordinary into something meaningful.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience made me more aware of the importance of empathy and giving back to the community. I learned that small gestures, whether it is a donation or a handmade note, can bring joy to others. I plan to continue participating in activities like this, not just for school requirements.
