      <h2>CSS Bazaar: Art Co-op Booth</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday to Friday, August 26-29, 2025, from 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM, we held a community-based project at Silliman University, UCS Building, where we organized a bazaar to support small artists in selling their art. Me and Angelina Kelley served as the lead organizer for this event, which aimed to give local and student artists a platform to showcase and earth from their creative works. Originally, we planned to join the Silliman Hibalag Booth, but due to the venues registration closure, we decided to hold the event at the CCS Bazaar instead. It took a month long preparation until we were able to reach out to artists, finish up the logistics, and promote the event. But all the hard work paid when we finally saw our displays of their creations.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, I learned valuable skills in event management, communication, and problem-solving. I initially expected the event to run smoothly, but I quickly realized how demanding and detailed-oriented organizing could be. I even got sick during the last half of the event. I was pleasantly surprised by the creativity that the artists have made. Their passion for their art inspired me deeply. One of the artists in particular has great artistic skills in making traditional art but was having a hard time trying to find people who were willing to support her, which inspired me and Angelina to make this project. The most difficult part was managing everything from morning until afternoon. This activity reflected my values of service, collaboration, and creativity, as it reminded me that leadership is about creating opportunities for others to grow. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience has broadened my perspective on how community support can uplift individuals in creative fields. I learned that leadership is not just about planning but also about patience. I can apply this learning by continuing to support local artists and organizing more community events to promote creativity. I believe that this has a benefit in building a supportive artistic community and teamwork. If I could do this again, I would have tried my best to research more on how to handle a big group of individuals.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more confident in my leadership skills. I have come to appreciate how art can bring people together. I plan to support local creativity more in the near future.

      <h2>FPBC: Buñao Daycare Feeding Program</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, September 24, 2025, from 3:00PM to 5:00PM, our group held an outreach activity at Buñao Daycare. I served as one of the Organizers and Head of the Food Committee, and our objective was to entertain and feed the children in the daycare center. Before the event began, I had to work earlier to help the head organizer with preparing the food and setting up materials needed for the program. It was really fun to organize it with them.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come to learn how to be patient and manage time with a group around. I thought the event would be simple by serving food and playing with the children. But it actually requires much more effort and coordination behind the scenes. What surprised me the most was how energetic and excited the children were. One of the children told me that I was pretty even though I was a bit tired during that time. The most challenging part was making sure all of the food was evenly distributed to the children, but the most satisfying part was when they actually enjoyed it. This activity reflected my values of service and teamwork, as it reminded me of how meaningful it is to give without expecting anything in return.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience reminded me that even small acts of kindness can have a big impact on others which broadened my worldview. I learned the importance of community involvement. In the future, I plan to continue volunteering in similar activities with friends. I see a lot of benefits in doing these types of activities. If I could do the activity again, I would do my best to prepare more in planning out the distribution process to have a smoother coordination.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more compassionate. I have become aware of the small impacts of my actions. I am motivated to continue serving others and make a difference in the community.

      <h2>FPBC: Cangmating Beach Clean Up</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, October 12, 2025, from 5:00 AM to 6:00 AM, our group held a beach cleanup at Cangmating, Sibulan. I served as one of the sub-organizers, helping with the coordination and ensuring that everyone had the materials they needed for the cleanup. Our goal was to clean the beach area to promote environmental awareness. It was not my first time visiting this beach since I had been there for a church event before, but this experience felt a bit different because we were working for a purpose to make a positive impact in our community.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the organizing team, I helped guide others on how to properly sort the trash, by separating plastics, papers, glass, and bottles. We could not just pile everything together, proper segregation was important to ensure that recyclables were handled correctly. It was physically tiring even when carrying those big bags of trash. Still, seeing the beach transform from littered to clean was deeply satisfying. It made me proud of what we accomplished as a team and reminded me of how service and cooperation reflect my personal values.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience taught me how even small organized efforts can lead to meaningful change. It strengthened my appreciation for the environment and for the people who work behind the scenes to maintain it. Moving forward, I plan to keep joining and helping organize clean-up drives, and maybe prepare better next time.  I would probably bring those wagons for heavier waste.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I have become more responsible and aware of the impact our actions have on the environment. I have learned the importance of leadership in promoting community involvement and protecting nature. I now understand the frustration that locals may feel when visitors leave a mess.
