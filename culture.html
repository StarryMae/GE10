      <h2>CCS: Acquaintance Party</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, August 2, 2025, from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM, I was part of the working committee for the College of Computer Studies acquaintance party, ehld at Silliman University High School Department. The goal of the session was to make the event successful despite the limited preparation time we had. As the first year CS representative and a member of the secretariat, I was given the responsibility for finding a host and recruiting participants who were willing to perform on stage. It was my first official event under my department, I was so determined to help make the event a success.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned how to communicate more effectively and how to stay organized under pressure. I expected the preparation to be easier, but soon realized how much coordination and effort are required to manage an event within a tight schedule. What surprised me most was how cooperative everyone become as the event approached. The governor during that was really quick to solve a problem, he tried his best to motivate others. Everything came together during the actual event made all the stress worth it.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience definitely changed how I view teamwork and time management. I realized that even with limited time and resources, great result can still be achieved through cooperation and commitment. I also learned that communication is one of the most important factor in organizing any event. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more confident in my ability to handle responsibilities under pressure. I have become more appreciative of teamwork and the people around me who worked tirelessly to make the event successful. I wish to continue working with them in the future.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday, August 19, 2025, from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, I attended the Parade of Lights along Hibbard Avenue to Ravello Field in celebration of the opening of the Hibalag Festival at Silliman University. My main goal was simply experience and witness the event since it was my first time seeing the Parade of Lights. Being someone who is not from Dumaguete, I was curious and excited to see what makes this event special to the Silliman community.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was completely amazed by how lively and creative each departments representation was. They out so much effort in their lights, costumes, and music which such created such a beautiful atmosphere. I was so impressed by how oranized everything was despite the large crowd. The only difficult part was finding a good spot to watch everything because of how packed the streets were, but it was worth it.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stood there watching, I felt grateful to be part of a place that values creativity. It what I have a notice in being a part of Silliman, and it is quite wonderful. The parade reminded me taht even though I am new to this city, I can still enjoy every moment like its home. It was a beautiful night that left me feel at awe.

      <h2>Hibalag Festival: Parada Sillimaniana</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, August 27, 2025, from 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM, I am the Secretariat Committee and we were tasked to help out with the preparation for the Parada Sillimaniana, which started at Silliman University and ended at the Filomeno Cimafranca Ballfield. As part of the working committee, we were tasked to assist the Aesthetics committee in creating and ddecorationg the float for the parade. It took about a week of preparation, and although it was exhausting, it was exciting to see how everyone worked together to bring our vision to life. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly did not expect it to take that much effort and detail just to make one float. We spent hours painting, cutting, and decorating, and everyone was running around busy with their own task. There was was one time where we had do overtime at night in order to finish the float. But nonetheless it was fun.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from helping with the float, I also got to walk in the parade with some of my friend. It was exhausting, especially after all the preparation, but it was also a lot of fun. My were having a race with the Agriculture Department which was so entertaining to watch. I was surprised at how lively and energetic the atmosphere was, even after a long day of work.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience taught me a lot of patience, that not everything will go as planned. It takes a lot of effort to make this possible. It was was tiring but worth while.

      <h2>ASIN: Hining ng Lahi</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, September 19, 2025, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, I attended a musical performance at the Luce Auditorium in Silliman University. The event featured the famous Filipino band ASIN, known for their traditional and folk-inspired music. The goal of the session was to let the audience experience old Filipino music and appreciate its cultural roots. It was fascinating to hear instruments and melodies that felt both nostalgic and refreshing.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not think I would to enjoy the performance as much as I did. I thought old-style would not really interest me, but hearing ASIN perform live change my perspective. Their songs carried deep meanings about life, love, and the environment, and it made me realize how powerful music can be in telling stories and expressing emotions. I was so amazed by the instrument they used, it was quite unique and were ones I had never seen before. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminded me that even though time changes trends, old music still has a strong influence. I learned that preserving and appreciating traditional art forms is important because they tell the stories of who we are as a people. It was really nostalgic and magical hearing them perform such wonderful music.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more appreciative of Filipino culture and heritage. I learned to listen with an open mind and to value the beauty in older forms of art. It made me proud to see how music connects generations and continues to inspire people today.

      <h2>Yuko Takanashi Dance Company: The Unseen Flame</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, September 27, 2025, from 7:00 Pm to 9:00 PM, I attended a  performance at the Silliman University Luce Auditorium. The show was called The Unseen Flame by the Yuko Takahashi Dance Company, and it was a modern ballet about the tragic history of Japan. I went there as an attendee, and I honestly did not know what to expect at first. I thought it would just be a typical dance show, but it turned out to be something deeper and really emotional.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the performance was a unique experience. The movements of the dancers and the music felt powerful, even without any words. It was interesting how they were able to tell a story about Japans past just through dance. I also noticed how graceful yet intense the dancers were, it made me realize how much effort and emotion go into performing. One thing that surprised me was how I could actually feel the sadness and strength in their movements. It made me appreciate how art can express things that are sometimes hard to say.
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience really opened my eyes to how dance and art can tell stories and preserve culture. I learned that you do not need to fully understand everything to be moved by it. I am glad I got to see it because it made me appreciate art in a new way.

      <h2>Pasipo Vocal Ensemble: The Art of Opera</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, October 18, 2025, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, I attended The Art of Opera performed by the Pasipo Vocal Ensemble at the Luce Auditorium in Silliman University. I went there as an attendee, simply curious about what opera would be like since I have mostly only heard about it but never actually experienced it live. So I bought my own tickets just to see how it was like. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought opera would be hard to appreciate because it is in a different language and has such a formal reputation. But when the performance started, I was amazed by how powerful and emotional the singers voices were. Even without understanding every word, I could still feel the emotions through their tone, expression, and movements. I was surprised by how passionate and dramatic it all was, it felt like a mix of theater and music, but on a much deeper level. I was so amazed by how they could control their own voices in such a high note for a long period of time. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned that music does not really need a translation. It is not something old or boring, it is actually quite beautiful. Buying those tickets were worth it in my opinion. But next time I would research more about the pieces beforehand.
