        <h2>Hibalag Cup 2025: Ultimate Frisbee</h2>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, August 1, 2025, from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM, I attended a frisbee tournament at the Filomeno Cimafranca Ballfield as an attendee. My objective was to simply watch the tournament, but it became a more interesting experience than I expected. I stayed at the center of the field with the Red Cross helpers as one of my friends is part of the group. I was observing the players as they competed with each other. It was my first time watching an actual frisbee tournament, since the sport is quite uncommon in my previous campus in Cebu. 
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My initial thought was that frisbee was just a casual game of throwing and catching, but I soon realized that it takes skill, communication, and quick decision-making. I was impressed by how organized and disciplined the teams were, as well as how they showed respect toward one another. The most fulfilling part of the experience was witnessing the players' sportsmanship and unity. 
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event gave me something new to watch, I usually just see volleyball or basketball tournaments in Cebu. This gave me a new perspective on how broad sports can be. It reminded me that trying something unfamiliar can lead to new learning and appreciation. One day, I would like to learn how to play frisbee myself so I could play with some of my friends in Tayasan, just a small game though, I dont have the same stamina like an athlete. 
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more open to exploring new things. Especially new hobbies and stuff. I want to appreciate the effort and the joy of learning something new.

        <h2>Hibalag Cup 2025: VolleyBall</h2>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, August 10, 2025, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, I attended the volleyball tournament at the Filomeno Cimafranca Ballfield as an attendee. My main goal was to support my friends from the Computer Studies department, who were competing in the event. After watching the Ultimate Frisbee tournament earlier that day, I immediately went to the volleyball court to cheer for them. I have always loved watching volleyball, but this time it felt more meaningful because I was there not just as a spectator, but as a friend rooting for their success.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my first time seeing my friend play with such determination to win which made me realize how much effort they had put into preparing. Every game they really want to win, not only for themselves but also for the entire team. I felt genuinely proud watching them give their all on the court. The were some tense moments whcih made the whole experience quite exciting.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have learned that supporting others success can be fulfilling. It reminded me when I also tried my best to compete in a chess tournament, it wasnt easy but I tried my best to play the game. I understand how they feels to win or lose. I realized that being present for others, even in simple ways like cheering or offering encouragement, can mean a lot. I wish I could stay much longer and support more of my friend who were competing that day. 
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more appreciative of the hard work and dedication my friends did for this game. I will keep supporting them for the love of the game. And I also feel more connected to my departments community.

        <h2>CCS: Chess Tournament</h2>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wedenesday, October 8, 2025, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, I took part in a chess tournament held at the USC Building as the assistant organizer. For about one to two weeks, my friends and I prepared for this event by promting it to students, setting up the venue, and organizing the match. As someone who loves playing chess, it was exciting for me to be involved not just as a player but as someone who helped make the event possible. My main objective was to explain the rules, facilitate, and assist on the certificates. The main goal was just to have fun.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was quite challenging than I thought it would. When I tried testing out the game with someone, he was very determined to win the match. I was quite impressed by how most participants showed great focus during the event. It seems that there are a lot of CCS students that really do like playing chess. Seeing everyone engaged made the effort worthwhile. 
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience helped me realize how meaningful it is to support something you are passionate about. I learned that small efforts like helping your friends for a successful event can make a difference. I have come to appreciate all the contributions and effort we made to make this event happen. 
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activity, I am more appreciative of the people organizing events. I am proud to have contribute to something that brought people together through a shared interest. This inspired me to do something similar next year for the new freshies who wish to do this types of events.

        <h2>FPBC: Billiard Tournament</h2>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, October 22, 2025, from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM, I served as the sub-organizer for a billiard competition held at Daniel13, Dumaguete City. The event aimed to do a friendly competition among player in CS. As part of my role, I was responsible for checking attendance, arranging player matchups, and ensuring the playing area remained organized. Having prior experience in event management, I wanted to make sure that the tournament would run smoothly. 
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My responsibilities were simple but it did require a lot of attention when arranging player matchups. Being attentive was very important since some participant arrived at different times. Small task can be very crucial, especially when tracking there scores as it does helped maintain the flow of the event. It was quite fun to see how there are some players that are trying their best to actually learn while playing the game. It was quite rewarding on how players enjoyed themselves all throughout the game.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience reminded me that even with my prior experience, there is always something new to learn from others. Every experience I have had made me realize the importance of recognizing the efforts of every person who made these events possible. I have also learned how crucial it is to be more observant when overseeing a competition.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this activty, I am more confident on my abilities to organize events. I am proud of how I contributed to the success of the event. I have come to be motivated to do better and improve my skills in doing more events like this.
